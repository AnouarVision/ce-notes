At the core of any digital system are <strong>electrical circuits</strong>, through which data is transmitted and stored. A real circuit can be in 2 fundamental states: <strong>closed</strong> (current flows) or <strong>open</strong> (no current).",
                "This concept becomes clearer by observing what happens in a real circuit.",
                "In hardware, these 2 conditions are realized and recognized through <strong>voltage levels</strong>: the presence of a voltage above a certain threshold indicates a closed circuit, while absence (or a very low voltage) indicates an open circuit. Unlike the analog world, where values can vary continuously, these states are <strong>discretized</strong>, i.e., intentionally reduced to a finite number of possibilities.",

                "The choice to use <strong>only two distinct states</strong> is not random. Two-level systems (open/closed circuit, low/high voltage) are: easier to design, more stable over time, less sensitive to electrical noise and environmental variations.",
                "In the presence of disturbances, it is much easier to correctly distinguish <strong>two well-separated states</strong> than many intermediate levels. For this reason, the physical behavior of the circuit is represented abstractly by associating these two states with two conventional symbols: 0 and 1. This gives birth to the <strong>binary system</strong>, which is the basis of all computer operation.",
                "The single binary symbol, <strong>0</strong> or <strong>1</strong>, is called a <strong>bit</strong> (contraction of binary digit).
